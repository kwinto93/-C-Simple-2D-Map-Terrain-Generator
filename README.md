# -C-Simple-2D-Map-Terrain-Generator
My own, 2D map generator, created using .Net and SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library). At the moment it generates only land surrounded by water, but in the future I would like to add heightmaps.

Features:
- simple GUI, providing access to the most important land generating algorithm variables (in progress)
- you can export the map of the solution to the *.png (in progress)
- you can see the solution in the separate window
